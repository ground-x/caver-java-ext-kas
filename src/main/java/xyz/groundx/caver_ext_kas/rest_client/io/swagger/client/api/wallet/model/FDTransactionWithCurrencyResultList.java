 * Wallet API
 * # Introduction Wallet API is an API for creating and managing Klaytn accounts as well as sending transactions. If you create your Klaytn account using Wallet API, you don't have to manage your private key yourself. Wallet API provides a wallet for safe storage of your Klaytn account private keys that you would need to use BApps. For more details on how to use Wallet API, please refer to this [tutorial](https://docs.klaytnapi.com/v/en/tutorial).  Wallet API can be divided into the Account part, which creates and manages Klaytn accounts, and the Transaction part, which sends different kinds of transactions.  Wallet API creates, deletes and monitors Klaytn accounts and updates the accounts to multisig, and manages all private keys for all accounts registered on KAS.  Wallet API can also create transaction to send it to Klaytn. These include transactions sent from multisig accounts. In case of muiltisig accounts, a transaction will automatically be sent to Klaytn once \\(Threshold\\) is met. For more detail, please refer to this [tutorial](https://docs.klaytnapi.com/v/en/tutorial).  There are mainly two types of transactions: basic transactions and fee delegation transactions. Fee delegation transactions include Global Fee Delegation transaction and user fee deletation transaction. With the Global Fee Delegation transaction scheme, the transaction fee will initially be paid by GroundX and then be charged to you at a later date. With the User Fee Delegation transaction scheme, you create an account that pays the transaction fees on behalf of the users when a transaction.
